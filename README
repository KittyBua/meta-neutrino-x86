This is my first try at creating a layer for building
the neutrino-mp set-top-box software.

Some stuff in here has been copied over from meta-magpie
(git://github.com/project-magpie/meta-magpie.git)

It is not yet finished and some hacks in it need improvement.
There's probably also some stuff in there which should move into
other layers or be pushed back upstream into the board BSPs,
especially everything recipes-raspi and recipes-local.
This is on my TODO list :-)

Anyway, have a lot of fun...

It s nothing in here that reinvents the wheel. It is mostly a collection of dirty hacks to get things working somehow. Just to be correctly and to express, that forking and improving this layers is very welcome: 

All changes that i have made to this layer are published under the BSD-2-Clause License. You should find a copy of the license in your yocto/poky/meta/files/common-licenses folder
